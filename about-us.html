                            Mysore, officially Mysuru, is a city in the state of Karnataka, India. It is located in the
                            foothills of the Chamundi Hills about 145 km towards the southwest of Bangalore.

                            It served as the capital city of the Kingdom of Mysore for nearly six centuries from 1399
                            until 1956. The Kingdom was ruled by the Wadiyar dynasty, with a brief period of interregnum
                            in the 1760s to 1770s when Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan were in power.

                            The Wadiyars were patrons of art and culture and contributed significantly to the cultural

                            Mysore earned it the sobriquet cultural Capital of Karnataka.

                            Mysore is noted for its heritage structures and palaces, including the Mysore Palace, and
                            for the festivities that take place during the Dasara festival when the city receives a
                            large number of tourists from around the world. It lends its name to various art forms and
                            culture, such as Mysore Dasara, Mysore Painting, the sweet dish Mysore Pak, Mysore masala

                            Darshini has multiple meanings, one among them means “Presents” like for example Colombia
                            Pictures Presents or Sony entertainment presents… hence Mysore Presents. Darshini has also
                            become a category of restaurants in Karnataka which serves fresh and simple soul foods.
                            Mysore Darshini’s motto is “NO CONFUSION THROUGH FUSION” meaning we try our best to create
                            food the way it was traditionally prepared to satisfy one’s soul.

                            Mr Shailendra Jayaraj alias Shailu, by education qualification is an Engineer in computer
                            science and was an IT project manager by profession with more than 25 years of IT
                            experience. From the very young age, he was always passionate about food and restaurant
                            industry. Cooking which was a hobby from childhood became a reality when his father tasked
                            him with setting up a restaurant in his home town of Mysore for Shailu’s younger brother.
                            Though Shailu’s family followed a vegetarian diet, a small non Vegetarian restaurant was
                            started in one of the alleys of downtown Mysore. In a span of 6 months the restaurant had
                            not only become known in Mysore but also in surrounding towns and cities of Mysore, for its
                            authenticity, freshness and soul food.
                        </div>

                            The successful venture gave confidence to his father and another restaurant with 8 times the
                            seating capacity was opened in an opulent area of Mysore which also was a major success,
                            after handing over the restaurants to his brother, Shailu went in pursuit of an IT career to
                            different countries in the world. While travelling in different part of the world, one thing
                            he observed in common was the lack of Authentic Indian food, it was such a rarity that he
                            started cooking not only for himself but for his colleagues and friends. The practice of
                            cooking for large numbers has never left him and the volume of people visiting his home has
                            been ever increasing. He not only enjoys cooking but feels immensely happy to serve his
                            friends with a smile.

                            25 years after opening his first restaurant, the passion, nostalgia and the quest for
                            authentic food has come back to haunt Shailu and he was eagerly looking forward to open a
                            restaurant in the Brampton and Mississauga area of Canada.

                            A fight for survival and facing challenges head on is not new to Shailu, not many know that
                            he was born with very weak legs and was not able to stand on his own legs until the age of
                            6. After all the doctors of that era gave up hope, his Grandma Mrs Renuka Devi nurtured the
                            young Shailu by giving her home based treatment for years and made sure the young Shailu 
                            not only stood but walk and later on travel to multiple countries. During this time of
                            nurturing, as Shailu was unable to walk, he spent a lot of time in the kitchen when his
                            grandma was busy cooking for a huge joint family. During those times in the kitchen his
                            favorite toys was a small knife, a cutting board, a mortar and pestle not just for playing
                            but to help his grandma by chopping onions, garlic, vegetables, greens, crush hard spices
                            and even grind the masala for the curries using the stone hand grinder. The taste and aromas
                            of his Grandma’s cooking registered a permanent memory in him and he was also able to keenly
                            observe the process of meticulous cooking his grandma followed.

                            His quest for authentic food and most importantly the right ingredients for any particular
                            dish was instrumental in creating a network of friends and relatives who not only have the
                            right knowledge but can also supply him with those ingredients on a continuous basis.

                            End of 2018, Shailu left his high paying comfortable IT job and wore the chef apron and
                            started a new restaurant which will pride itself in serving the best home style cooking and classic
                            south Indian food.
